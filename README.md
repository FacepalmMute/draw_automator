# draw_automator

This application imports images, converts them to a list of lines and draw them manually in a selected region.
It could be useful for artists or for cheating in draw based games like skribbl.io ;)

# How to use

1. Import image
You can paste an image right out of your clipboard or drag it into the application window.
The pasting of URLs and base64 coded images is supported but is still in an experimental state.

2. Select drawing region
After you adjusted the contour detection with the slider you can arm the application by pressing the button.
Your next click and release determines a rectangle in which the picture should be painted.
Always begin in the upper left corner and release it at the bottom right corner.

3. Wait
The picture should now be painted. The automation can be stopped by shaking the mouse randomly in all directions.
